everyone gets one 🍪

# okay but for real
Simple website I made to ~~give everyone cookies~~ learn a few new bits of software!

Including but not limited to
  * express
  * cookies
  * mongodb
  * pug/jade
  * what a templating engine is in the first place
  * pixel art cookie production
  * mongoosejs

The website gives everyone a unique cookie on their first visit, and saves it to make sure 
nobody else can have it again. On subsequent visits the site displays the user's cookie.
